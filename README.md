# SFB_kinzig2021
In this repository, I saved all the R scripts and dataset used for running statistical analysis for our SFB RESIST Kinzig 2021 microphytobenthos sampling campaign.
The dataset and R scripts saved here were used to prepare a manuscript that we submitted for publication in Hydrobiologia
We investigated the functional and compositional responses of microphytobenthos communities to surrounding land uses in the Kinzig River catchment, central Germany. 
We measured photosynthetic biomass using a Benthotorch, and analysed the diatom community using a newly developed digital light microscopy approach and 18S-V9 amplicon sequencing, 
to characterise the whole protistan assemblages at sampling sites located in rural vs. urban areas.
